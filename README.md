# Gravity Task ðŸ‘‹ [here](https://rkpassin132-map.netlify.app/)
A simple one page web app using ReactJs.

- The app takes location inputs of "Origin" & "Destination" and then plots the route on maps along with distance.
- Thereâ€™s an option for users to add multiple stops on the route - when a user adds a stop, it becomes a waypoint between Origin & Destination. Adding stops is optional
- Input validation - Origin & Destination inputs should fetch location from Google maps autosuggest. Users should not be able to add anything else.
